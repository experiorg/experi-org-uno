<H1> Current Activity</H1>

<p>
My plan is to tidy up what I already have, get some feedback on things. And start doing a shed load of research to fill out the library. I'm planning on starting with the history of corruption and political theory about organisations that I can see if I can appropriate. 
</p>
<p> If there are any other things I should be doing, give me a shout at <anything> @experi.org. </p>

<p> Once things are tidy-ish I point google at us ( althought it looks like the google bots have said hello already)</p>

<p> Something else for me to read up on "Experimental Organizational Economics" </p>
