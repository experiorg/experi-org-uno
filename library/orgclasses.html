<p>
This is going to be a brain dump of how I think about organisations. It will get broken down.
</p>
<p> 
At their heart an organisation is a decision making process, that somehow involves people. You can break down the different types of organisation based upon the inputs it takes to make decisions and how they are transformed into decisions.
</p>
<p> 
The first major split is between organisations that have direct human input into the decision process and those that are automated. Automated decision processes have some human input, in that humans choose the automated process, but on a day to day basis they are left alone. I shall concentrate on organisations that keep humans in the loop somehow, to start with as they are more familiar to people. However they suffer from the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_agent_problem">principal-agent problem.</a> That is how to motivate an some people to work for the best interests of a whole group of people and not just themselves.
</p>
<h2>Human-centric</h2>
<p>
In the human-centric version we are seeking a system that encourages the humans to make or participated good decisions for the organisation as a whole, not just for them. In general they have some form of communication from the organisation back to the the decision makers that seeks to act as a form of pressure on the decision makers so they make the right decisions. In voting the pressure is the chance of being re-elected. In an economic transaction the pressure is wanting to keep the persons repeat business.
</p>
<p> 
In this case there is another fairly major split. Whether each decision is made by one person or by some interaction of many people. The first case we shall call delegated and the second dispersed. 
</p>

<p>
Examples
</p><ul>
<li> 
Delegated - Voting for a single leader
</li>
<li> 
Dispersed - Direct democracy on each subject.
</li>
<ul>

You can layer these systems. Representative democracy layers deputised,  you vote for one person who then makes dispersed decisions on your behalf.
