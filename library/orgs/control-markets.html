<h2>Simple Summary</h2>
Actors bid on control over decisions to do with resources for a period using currency. Stakeholders give feedback on the decisions made by the actor. Actors gain an amount of currency based upon that feedback. 


If how well a resource is used is not immediately apparent to stakeholders, it does not get feedback directly. Instead, actors who have control over it have use the resource to help other Actors in return for currency. Forming a network


<h2>Formal Description </h2>


<h2>Potential Downsides</h2>

<h3>Short termism</h3>
<p>
Actors are encouraged to optimise their actions for only the current period. Actions may have negative effects on later days. Which may not effect them.  
</p>
<p> Possible solution: Profit is not entirely based upon the feedback of that round. So split up the profit over  N later rounds.  So if N is 5 and an Actor bids 100 credits and at time 1 feedback is 150 then the actor get 110 (b +  (f1 - b)/5 if f1 > b else f1 ) at time 1. At time 2 (f2 - b)/5 if f2 > b else 0 etc    </p>

<p> This would align the
<h3>Monetary Concentration</h3>
<p>
It takes money to make money. So those with currency might be able to get more of it just by lending it out.
</p>
<p>How much of a problem this is, has yet to be seen. As long as money lenders are allowed to fail if they lend badly this may be okay. </p>
