 <div class="span6">
    A website for a community dedicated to creating less corruptable organizations for the future. This page is very much a work in progress as it is supposed to be a nice visual page.
  </div>


    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
    <li><a href="#why" data-toggle="tab">Why</a></li>
    <li><a href="#profile" data-toggle="tab">What</a></li>
    </ul>

<div class="tab-pane" id="why">
<div>#Picture of various news headlines to do with corruption. Enron, watergate, expenses scandels, gulags. Some even more historic? </div> 

Because Democracy, Capitalism, the PLC all have their flaws. However the alternatives we know about such as communism seem to have their own problems. So we need new ways of doing things. So rather than being anti-capitalist, or anti-democracies Experi.org seeks to be pro something better. Something that people want to be part of. This is the first step on that journey.
</p>
<p>
In order for this prcoess to be worthwhile. Two things have to be true.
</p><p>
1. The problem with current organisations is that they encourage the wrong things, not that the people in them are somehow incompetent or worse than other people.
</p><p>
2. Through theory and experimentation we can find better organisations types to encourage people to fulfil the purpose of that organisation.
</p>
</div>

<div class="tab-pane" id="what" >
<p>
The focus of this website is the nature of corruption in organizations and how to prevent it through better structures. People are expected to still be self-serving, but the new structures should mean that the selfishness of the person and the organization's purpose are more closely aligned.
</p>
As such this website will be a central place for people to get informed about the latest organizational innovations and experiments. It has four goals.

<h3> Explore </h3>
There are a number a fields that are worth knowing while designing organizations. These include such things as political theory, economic,  psychology and game theory. This site will have a introductions to relevant research and also try and post interesting new pieces in the blog.

<h3> Create </h3>
Different organizations require different infrastructure. For example a democracy needs a way of tallying votes for different people, other organisations need more complex ways of interacting with each other.

<h3> Experiment </h3>
Our organizations are important, they keep the world working. It makes sense to trial organizations on a small scale to see how they work. These experiments will vary in character, from a strict academic setting to testing it in club. Also at some point there will be a game platform to test different organisations against each other. 

<h3> Teach</h3>
<p>
There is no point in having a great well tested organizational method if no one knows of its existance or how it works. So while performing experiments we shoulld also make documentaries and youtube videos of what it is like to be inside them.
</p><p>
Another goal is to have an academic community devoted to this subject, to get more bright minds working on it.
