    A website for a community dedicated to creating less corruptable organizations for the future. This page is very much a work in progress as it is supposed to be a nice visual page.
  </div>


    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" id="questions"> 
    <li class="active"><a href="#why" data-toggle="tab">Why</a></li>
    <li><a href="#what" data-toggle="tab">What</a></li>
    <li><a href="#how" data-toggle="tab">How</a></li>
    </ul>

<div>#Picture of various news headlines to do with corruption. Enron, watergate, expenses scandels, gulags. Some even more historic? </div> 
<p>
Corruption is widespread through our society. From major events like the Enron scandel to low level inefficiency in  government it has a massive impact on our day to day lives. People aren't inherently evil, so it is the type of organisations that we create that are at fault.
</p>
<p>
Organisational structures set up different incentives for people in them. For example during a vote a person running for the post needs to convince you that they will do better than the other people that can be voted for. So it encourages them to be convincing and denigrate the other people, rather than actually being any better than the other person for the post in question.  
</p>
<p>
Incentive structures and people are complex things and can interact in weird ways. So we need to test them out and experiment with them. So we get them right on the small scale before we use them in the real world.

<div class="tab-pane fade" id="what" >
<p>
The focus of this website is the nature of corruption in organizations and how to prevent it through better structures. People are expected to still be self-serving, but the new structures should mean that the selfishness of the person and the organization's purpose are more closely aligned.
</p>
As such this website will be a central place for people to get informed about the latest organizational innovations and experiments. It has four goals.

<h3> Explore </h3>
There are a number a fields that are worth knowing while designing organizations. These include such things as political theory, economic,  psychology and game theory. This site will have a introductions to relevant research and also try and post interesting new pieces in the blog.

<h3> Create </h3>
Different organizations require different infrastructure. For example a democracy needs a way of tallying votes for different people, other organisations need more complex ways of interacting with each other.

<h3> Experiment </h3>
Our organizations are important, they keep the world working. It makes sense to trial organizations on a small scale to see how they work. These experiments will vary in character, from a strict academic setting to testing it in club. Also at some point there will be a game platform to test different organisations against each other. 

<h3> Teach</h3>
<p>
There is no point in having a great well tested organizational method if no one knows of its existance or how it works. So while performing experiments we shoulld also make documentaries and youtube videos of what it is like to be inside them.
</p><p>
Another goal is to have an academic community devoted to this subject, to get more bright minds working on it.
