Give us feedback - What are we doing wrong? If something is unclear let us know. mail@experi.org 
</ul><ul>
Theorise - Design an experimental organisation type!
</ul><ul>
Experiment - Assemble a team to do an experiment with. Research possible experiments and relevant experiments that have already happened.
</ul><ul>
Write a blog post - Either here or somewhere else on the subject on experimenting with organisation. 
</ul><ul>
Talk to your friends about the idea - Just spreading the idea is useful.
</ul><ul>
Reddit - We could do with a reddit for people to chat. So set one up! 
</ul><ul>
Social Media - Follow us and participate on twitter @Experiorg, <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116396649779837829298">Google Plus</a>  or  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Experiorg">Facebook</a>, 
</ul><ul>
Library to wiki - The library is currently in need of wikification. I'll get on this in a bit.
</ul><ul>
Research a wiki page - Research a topic for the wiki, for example Game theory or the psychology of motivation and present the relevant information for someone trying to design an organisational structure. With references! 
</ul><ul>
Redesign the website - It is pretty bad at the moment.
</ul><ul>
Set up a charity in the US - I suspect this will be the place most  accepting of the idea, and tax relief never hurt anyone.
</ul><ul>
Become a director of a UK based organisation - Charity? 
</ul><ul>
Other - Something I have forgotten. Let us know what you've done at mail@experi.org
