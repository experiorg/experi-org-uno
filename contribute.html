<p>
This website's function during this time is to document a common base of language and knowledge for the community. The library will be moved off to a github A wiki will be formed at some point, but pull requests are welcome (this is all done on github, at the moment). There are wiki pages in github which might work. However I am not sure how to extract all the data, if we want to move to something else at some point.</p>

We are not accepting donations at the moment. We have no bank account with which to do so. Ideally we would run kickstarter like campaigns to fund each experiment and keep this org lean. Once I have run out of steam I might do one to get a design/proofread for this site.

</ul><ul>
Give us feedback - What are we doing wrong? If something is unclear let us know. mail@experi.org 
</ul><ul>
Write a blog post - Either here or somewhere else on the subject on experimenting with organisation. 
</ul><ul>
Talk to your friends about the idea - Just spreading the idea is useful.
</ul><ul>
Reddit - We could do with a reddit for people to chat. So set one up! 
</ul><ul>
Social Media - Follow us and participate on twitter @Experiorg, <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/116396649779837829298">Google Plus</a>  or  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Experiorg">Facebook</a>, 
</ul><ul>
Library to wiki - The library is currently in need of wikification. I'll get on this in a bit.
</ul><ul>
Research a wiki page - Research a topic for the wiki, for example Game theory or the psychology of motivation and present the relevant information for someone trying to design an organisational structure. With references! 
</ul><ul>
Redesign the website - It is pretty bad at the moment.
</ul><ul>
Set up a charity in the US - I suspect this will be the place most  accepting of the idea, and tax relief never hurt anyone.
</ul><ul>
Become a director of a UK based organisation - Charity? 
</ul><ul>
Other - Something I have forgotten. Let us know what you've done at mail@experi.org
</ul>

<p>
Also WORD OF MOUTH! Asking questions around the water cooler like, "I saw this website and it made me wonder: If there is so much corruption in X organisation, why haven't tried to find a better way?" will get people wondering and hopefully inspire people to explore and think about it themselves.
</p>
<p>
However help is required. If you have ideas for a blog post or library article feel a pull request/raw html or just the text would be appreciated. Also just generally spreading the idea around, blogging about it.
</p>
<p>
The first goal is to assemble a team to do an experiment and have a decent website for people to come and learn about experimenting with organisations.
