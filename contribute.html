title: Experi.org - Experiments in the future of Organizations

<div>
<p>
We are not accepting donations at the moment. We have no bank account with which to do so. At the moment ideally we would run kickstarter like campaigns to fund each experiment and keep this org lean. Once I have run out of steam I might do one to get a design/proofread for this site.

<p>
However help is required. If you have ideas for a blog post or library article feel a pull request/raw html or just the text would be appreciated. Also just generally spreading the idea around, blogging about it.

The first goal is to assemble a team to do an experiment and have a decent website for people to come and learn about experimenting with organisations.
