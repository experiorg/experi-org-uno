title: Experi.org - Experiments in the future of Organizations
---
<p>
Zeroth Goal: Build a self-sustaining community around the idea of experimenting with organizations. To this end we need things like reddits, discussion groups and research and experiments for them to discuss. If you want to take ownership or have a blog with this function give me an{{email}}. I have an experi.org facebook page, feel free to  like
</p>
<p>
Also WORD OF MOUTH! Asking questions around the water cooler like, "I saw this website and it made me wonder: If there is so much corruption in X organisation, why haven't tried to find a better way?" will get people wondering and hopefully inspire people to explore and think about it themselves.
<p>
This website's function during this time is to document a common base of language and knowledge for the community. A wiki will be formed at some point, but pull requests are welcome (this is all done on github, at the moment). There are wiki pages in github which might work. However I am not sure how to extract all the data, if we want to move to something else at some point.
